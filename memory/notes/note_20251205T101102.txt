## Thermodynamics (Chemistry)

Thermodynamics in chemistry deals with energy changes accompanying physical and chemical processes. It helps predict the feasibility and direction of a reaction.

### 1. Key Concepts & Definitions

*   **System**: The part of the universe under thermodynamic study.
*   **Surroundings**: Everything else in the universe outside the system.
*   **Boundary**: Separates the system from the surroundings.

*   **Types of Systems**:
    *   **Open System**: Exchanges both matter and energy with surroundings (e.g., boiling water in an open beaker).
    *   **Closed System**: Exchanges energy but NOT matter with surroundings (e.g., boiling water in a closed beaker).
    *   **Isolated System**: Exchanges neither matter nor energy with surroundings (e.g., perfectly insulated thermos flask).

*   **State Functions**: Properties that depend only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path taken (e.g., Pressure, Volume, Temperature, Internal Energy, Enthalpy, Entropy, Gibbs Free Energy).
*   **Path Functions**: Properties that depend on the path taken (e.g., Heat, Work).

*   **Intensive Properties**: Independent of the amount of matter (e.g., Temperature, Pressure, Density, Molar concentration).
*   **Extensive Properties**: Depend on the amount of matter (e.g., Mass, Volume, Internal Energy, Enthalpy, Entropy, Gibbs Free Energy).

*   **Thermodynamic Processes**:
    *   **Isothermal**: Temperature (T) remains constant (ΔT = 0).
    *   **Adiabatic**: No heat exchange (q = 0).
    *   **Isochoric**: Volume (V) remains constant (ΔV = 0).
    *   **Isobaric**: Pressure (P) remains constant (ΔP = 0).
    *   **Cyclic**: System returns to its initial state.
    *   **Reversible**: Occurs infinitely slowly, equilibrium maintained at each step.
    *   **Irreversible**: Occurs rapidly, system not in equilibrium.

### 2. Internal Energy (U) & First Law of Thermodynamics

*   **Internal Energy (U)**: The sum of all forms of energy (kinetic, potential, chemical, etc.) within a system. An extensive and state function.
*   **First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Conservation of Energy)**: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
    *   Mathematically: **ΔU = q + w**
        *   ΔU = change in internal energy
        *   q = heat supplied to the system (+ve if absorbed, -ve if released)
        *   w = work done on the system (+ve if done on, -ve if done by)

*   **Work (w)**: For expansion/compression of gas (pressure-volume work):
    *   **w = -PextΔV** (Pext = external pressure, ΔV = change in volume)
        *   Work done by the system (expansion) is negative.
        *   Work done on the system (compression) is positive.

### 3. Enthalpy (H)

*   **Enthalpy (H)**: A thermodynamic property useful for studying heat changes at constant pressure.
    *   **H = U + PV** (P = pressure, V = volume)
*   **Change in Enthalpy (ΔH)**: Heat change at constant pressure.
    *   **ΔH = ΔU + PΔV** (at constant pressure)
    *   For reactions involving gases: **ΔH = ΔU + Δn_g RT**
        *   Δn_g = (moles of gaseous products) - (moles of gaseous reactants)
        *   R = gas constant, T = temperature
*   **Heat Capacity (C)**: Amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance by 1°C or 1K.
    *   **C = q / ΔT**
    *   **Molar Heat Capacity (Cm)**: Heat capacity per mole of substance.
    *   **Specific Heat Capacity (s or c)**: Heat capacity per unit mass of substance.
*   **Relationship between Cp and Cv**:
    *   **Cp - Cv = R** (for an ideal gas)
        *   Cp = Molar heat capacity at constant pressure.
        *   Cv = Molar heat capacity at constant volume.

### 4. Spontaneity, Entropy (S) & Second Law of Thermodynamics

*   **Spontaneous Process**: A process that occurs on its own without external help (e.g., water flowing downhill, burning of charcoal).
*   **Entropy (S)**: A measure of the randomness or disorder of a system.
    *   **ΔS = q_rev / T** (q_rev = heat exchanged reversibly)
    *   Gases have higher entropy than liquids, which have higher entropy than solids.
    *   Increase in moles of gas in a reaction usually increases entropy.
*   **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: For a spontaneous process, the total entropy of the universe always increases.
    *   **ΔS_universe = ΔS_system + ΔS_surroundings > 0** (for spontaneous process)
    *   **ΔS_universe = 0** (for reversible/equilibrium process)

### 5. Gibbs Free Energy (G) & Spontaneity

*   **Gibbs Free Energy (G)**: A thermodynamic potential that measures the "useful" or process-initiating work obtainable from an isothermal, isobaric thermodynamic system.
    *   **G = H - TS**
*   **Change in Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG)**:
    *   **ΔG = ΔH - TΔS** (Gibbs-Helmholtz Equation)
    *   This is the most reliable criterion for spontaneity at constant T and P:
        *   **ΔG < 0**: Process is spontaneous (feasible).
        *   **ΔG > 0**: Process is non-spontaneous (requires energy input).
        *   **ΔG = 0**: System is at equilibrium.

*   **Influence of ΔH and ΔS on ΔG and Spontaneity**:
    | ΔH    | ΔS    | ΔG = ΔH - TΔS | Spontaneity                                |
    | :---- | :---- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
    | -     | +     | - (always)      | Spontaneous at all temperatures            |
    | +     | -     | + (always)      | Non-spontaneous at all temperatures        |
    | -     | -     | - at low T      | Spontaneous at low T, non-spontaneous at high T |
    | +     | +     | - at high T     | Spontaneous at high T, non-spontaneous at low T |

### 6. Third Law of Thermodynamics

*   **Third Law**: The entropy of a perfectly crystalline substance at absolute zero (0 K) is taken to be zero.
    *   This provides a reference point for calculating absolute entropies of substances.
